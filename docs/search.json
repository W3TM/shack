When the right sequence of DTMF tones is entered, I (and a couple of ham friends) are able to have our positions reported nearby some locations that are relevant to area hams: our mountaintop club station, the 146.85 W3YA and 146.76 W3GA repeaters, Hoss’s Restaurant, and the location where we hold our monthly club meetings.\nMore specific details about the rig and PC settings for this station can be found here.\n\n\nHF 1\nMy primary HF station that I am callig HF-1 just for fun uses the FlexRadio 6400 transceiver. The Flex drives an SPE Expert Linear 1K amplifier. The radio has an Inrad M629 microphone.

    "text": "Packet\nI’ve recently assembled a portable VHF packet/APRS/Winlink station. The radio is the ICOM ID-51a. A Digirig device with a cable specifically designed for ICOM HTs provides sound card and PTT functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe ID-51a supports CAT control via CI-V, and Digirig could support this. But CAT control is overkill for this use case. It’s trivial to change the radio frequency manually, and the mode does not need to change.\nThe Digirig cable takes the grounded speaker line from the ID-51a and sends it as an RTS signal to the computer. So, once I’ve set the packet software to use the correct COM port on the PC, PTT works well. The virtue of this scheme is that it can also work with other HTs.\n\n\nAn Evolve III netbook running Windows 10 runs the relevant software. I’m using the UH7HO Soundmodem package for packet radio TNC services, Dire Wolf as an APRS TNC, and Outpost Packet Message Manager as a packet terminal client. I also use Winlink, and the VARA FM Winlink client, but of course, I could also use standard packet as the Winlink client.\nThe IC-705 can also work as a portable FM + HF packet station using the same PC. I’m experimenting with making different copies of Soundmodem and VARA FM and then naming them for the different rig configurations, as neither package supports switching between multiple rigs."

Power output on power meter should be comparable to output set on rig (~5-50 W). Rig menu is 16-03 HF PWR.\nAdjust the output level by switching to F / MTR / ALC. Press tune. Then use the sndvol applet on the PC to reduce the speaker output until the ALC is at a minimum. To launch sndvol type it into the search bar and press enter.\n::: {.callout-warning}\nBecause digital modes are high duty-cycle modes, it’s best to use less than the full 100 W of output power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt can be useful to monitor the input (mic) and output (speaker) audio device levels on the PC.\nType “Control Panel” in the search bar. Open Hardware and Sound and open the Digirig output (from PC) or Speaker panel or the Digirig input (to PC) or Mic panel.\nPer Digirig instructions, the PC Speaker output is initially set at ~80%. But I have found that to reduce the ALC to a minimum means that my speaker level is ~15%.\nThe Mic level can be adjusted to achieve ideal “input” levels for a digital mode OR the rig RF Gain can be reduced. The latter control is more easily adjusted given different operating conditions.\nFull RF Gain results when the outer RF Gain knob on the rig is turned fully clockwise (to the right)."
