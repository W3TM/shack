    "text": "Ham radio bio\nI’ve wanted to be a ham since I was a teen.\nI started out as a shortwave listener with a long wire strung from my parents’ roof on our house in southwest Denver running to Yaesu FRG-7 receiver. Hearing the English language broadcast from Radio Tirana in Albania was one of the highlights.\nIn the spring of 1993, I got the ham bug again and studied for an passed my Technician Plus exam, including the 5 wpm code requirement. My callsign was N3QLO. But I had just gotten married and just started graduate school. So, I made one contact on a Radio Shack HT and largely forgot about ham radio. In fact, when my license renewal rolled around in 2003, I didn’t even bother to renew.\nThirteen years later, I’d gotten tenure, my kids were teens or out of the house, and I had a little more time and energy. I passed my Technician and General license exams in the summer of 2016, secured the vanity callsign K3ROG, and joined the Nittany Amateur Radio Club. This time, I made time for ham radio, and I’ve been rolling ever since. With the help of some study partners and my Elmer K3YV, I upgraded to Extra a year later.\nIn the winter of 2023, I changed callsigns again to W3TM, mostly on a lark. I saw that a callsign that was both phonetically short and CW-short was available, and so I decided to enter the callsign lottery when it became available. My understanding was that the chances were slim I would get the callsign, but I thought I would go for it anyway. Sure enough, there was only one other ham who was eligible, and I won the coin toss at the FCC. Ok, maybe they have a more sophisticated system of choosing randomly, but however it went down, whiskey-three-tango-mike was now my new call. And that call will remain until I am a silent key.\n\n\n\nW3TM QSL card"

The radio is the ICOM ID-51a. A Digirig device with a cable specifically designed for ICOM HTs provides sound card and PTT functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe ID-51a supports CAT control via CI-V, and Digirig could support this. But CAT control is overkill for this use case. It’s trivial to change the radio frequency manually, and the mode does not need to change.\nThe Digirig cable takes the grounded speaker line from the ID-51a and sends it as an RTS signal to the computer. So, once I’ve set the packet software to use the correct COM port on the PC, PTT works well. The virtue of this scheme is that it can also work with other HTs.\n\n\nAn Evolve III netbook running Windows 10 runs the relevant software. I’m using the UH7HO Soundmodem package for packet radio TNC services, Dire Wolf as an APRS TNC, and Outpost Packet Message Manager as a packet terminal client. I also use Winlink, and the VARA FM Winlink client, but of course, I could also use standard packet as the Winlink client.\nThe IC-705 can also work as a portable FM + HF packet station using the same PC. I’m experimenting with making different copies of Soundmodem and VARA FM and then naming them for the different rig configurations, as neither package supports switching between multiple rigs."

Illness forced a last minute cancellation, but carried out a JOTA activation for October 21, 2023 under the K3J special event callsign. About 15 cubs and their parents joined K3YV, W3EDP, KC3AF, and me at Circleville Park for some HF, VHF repeater, Morse Code, and FRS walkie-talkie fun.\n\n\nBirthplace of Memorial Day W3M\n\n\n\nW3M QSL Card\n\n\n\n\nFlight 93 20th Anniversary N3M\n\n\n\nN3M QSL card\n\n\nSeveral hams from NARC cooperated with hams from the Somerset County Amateur Radio club to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Flight 93 from a location near the memorial.\n\n\n\nN3M special event operation\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Dance Marathon K3T\nI helped the Penn State ARC secure the special event callsign K3T for an event honoring the Penn State Dance Marathon held in February 2023. The group of operators made several hundred QSOs, spreading positive news about ’Thon, Penn State, and the PSU club.\n\n\nPride K3P\nWith several friends from our local ham community, I organized a special event station to celebrate Pride Month in Central PA in early June 2023. My Allstar/EchoLink node was active, and a group of us did a Parks on the Air (POTA) activation at Bald Eagle State Park. We also had a booth at the State College Pride festival.\n\n\n\nK3P QSL card"

We have moved our exams to the ARRL-VEC.\n\n\nNew Ham Book\nJust for fun, I’ve started working on an electronic (web) book for new hams. The target audience was initially Penn State ARC members who aren’t (yet) licensed. But I am expanding it to be suitable for a wide range of folks who aren’t yet hams.\nYou can find the work-in-progress here:\nhttps://k3cr.github.io/newhambook/\nComments are welcome!"

Open Hardware and Sound and open the Digirig output (from PC) or Speaker panel or the Digirig input (to PC) or Mic panel.\nPer Digirig instructions, the PC Speaker output is initially set at ~80%. But I have found that to reduce the ALC to a minimum means that my speaker level is ~15%.\nThe Mic level can be adjusted to achieve ideal “input” levels for a digital mode OR the rig RF Gain can be reduced. The latter control is more easily adjusted given different operating conditions.\nFull RF Gain results when the outer RF Gain knob on the rig is turned fully clockwise (to the right)."
