Amateur radio has so many ways to be "radio-active". Here are some of the ways I enjoy engaging in our amazing hobby.

## Organizations

### American Radio Relay League (ARRL)

I am an active member of the [ARRL](https://arrl.org).

### Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)

I participate in the weekly ARES net on the W3YA 146.85 repeater as a participating station and as a net control station.

In addition, I enjoy providing communications for various special events via the ARES organization.

### Nittany Amateur Radio Club (NARC)

I have been a member of NARC since 2016. I help maintain the club's station on top of Pine Grove Mountain, and I have served on the Board of Directors since 2020.

### Penn State Amateur Radio Club (PSARC)

### Quarter Century Wireless Association (QCWA)

Our local QCQA Chapter 203 has a weekly net on Sunday nights at 8:30 PM local time on the W3YA 146.85 MHz repeater. I am one of the net control stations. 

## Other activities

### Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)

I operate a receive-only VHF (144.390 MHz) I-Gate under the callsign [W3TM-11](https://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=11&call=a%2FW3TM-11&timerange=3600&tail=3600).

### Volunteer Examiner

I am a registered Volunteer Examiner (VE) for W5YI and for the ARRL.

## Events

### Field Day

For the last several years, I have helped organize the NARC Field Day operation.

In the summer of 2020, during the height of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, I operated from my backyard.
