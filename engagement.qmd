Amateur radio has so many ways to be "radio-active". Here are some of the ways I enjoy engaging in our amazing hobby.

## Organizations

### American Radio Relay League (ARRL)

I am an active member of the [ARRL](https://arrl.org).

### Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)

I participate in the weekly ARES net on the W3YA 146.85 repeater as a participating station and as a net control station.

In addition, I enjoy providing communications for various special events via the ARES organization.

### Nittany Amateur Radio Club (NARC)

I have been a member of NARC since 2016. I help maintain the club's station on top of Pine Grove Mountain, and I have served on the Board of Directors since 2020.

### Penn State Amateur Radio Club (PSARC)

I serve as the faculty adviser for the Penn State ARC, and as trustee for the K3CR repeaters.

### Quarter Century Wireless Association (QCWA)

Our local QCQA Chapter 203 has a weekly net on Sunday nights at 8:30 PM local time on the W3YA 146.85 MHz repeater. I am one of the net control stations. 

## Other activities

### Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)

I operate a receive-only VHF (144.390 MHz) I-Gate under the callsign [W3TM-11](https://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=11&call=a%2FW3TM-11&timerange=3600&tail=3600).

### Volunteer Examiner (VE)

I am a registered Volunteer Examiner (VE) for W5YI and for the ARRL.

As of September 2023, I will be taking over the Coordinating VE role from K3YV.

## Events

### Field Day

For the last several years, I have helped organize the NARC Field Day operation.

In the summer of 2020, during the height of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, I operated from my backyard.

### Winter Field Day

I enjoy [Winter Field Day](https://www.winterfieldday.com).

In January 2020, W3SWL, N3LI, and I operated Winter Field Day from a cabin in Prince Gallitzin State Park.

In 2021, my wife and I stayed at a cabin in Black Moshannon State Park where I operated Winter Field Day.

In 2022, friends KC3HIP and W3EDP stayed with us in an adjoining cabin at Black Moshannon State Park.

We weren't able to operate in 2023, but hope to do so again in 2024.

### Jamboree on the Air (JOTA)

With K3YV and W3EDP, we planned an event with a local Cub Scouts troop for October 2022.
Illness forced a last minute cancellation, but we are talking about a JOTA activation for this coming October 2023.

### Birthplace of Memorial Day W3M

Several hams from NARC cooperated with hams from the Somerset County Amateur Radio club to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Flight 93 from a location near the memorial.

### Penn State Dance Marathon K3T

I helped the Penn State ARC secure the special event callsign K3T for an event honoring the Penn State Dance Marathon held in February 2023.
The group of operators made several hundred QSOs, spreading positive news about 'Thon, Penn State, and the PSU club.

### Pride K3P

With several friends from our local ham community, I organized a special event station to celebrate Pride Month in Central PA in early June 2023.
My Allstar/EchoLink node was active, and a group of us did a Parks on the Air (POTA) activation at Bald Eagle State Park.
We also had a booth at the State College Pride festival.
