### Yaesu FTM-400XDR

I bought the FTM-400 new in the box from K3ARL in the summer of 2022. 
He had bought it as a gift for his business partner and friend, Eric Brooks N3EB.
Sadly, N3EB died in the fall of 2021, and never got to enjoy the radio.
N3EB was one of my Elmers, and so I am glad that I get to enjoy this rig and remember Eric.

### Kenwood TM-2

The Kenwood TM-XXX is a mobile radio, but I use it in my home shack to support my [W3TM-11 I-Gate](https://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=11&call=a%2FW3TM-11&timerange=3600&tail=3600).
