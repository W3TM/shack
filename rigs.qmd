### ICOM IC-9700

![](https://www.gigaparts.com/media/catalog/product/cache/dfaec006bd6782dbad92b9435baa8bcf/i/c/ic_9700.jpg)
The IC-9700 is the newest rig in the shack.
I'm planning some additional VHF and UHF work with it, including satellites, and possibly a future APRStt project.
But for now, it's in the shack being used for local repeater operations.

I have experimented with remote control of this rig, but the latency is high.

### ICOM IC-705

The IC-705 is also capable of VHF and UHF operations at up to 10 W.

### Kenwood TM-710GA {}

This VHF (2 m)/UHF (70 cm) transceiver was purchased new in the summer of 2016.
It is installed in our Kia Forte.
I usually beacon APRS packets when I am mobile under the callsign W3TM-1.

### Yaesu FTM-400XDR

![Yaesu FTM-400XDR](https://www.yaesu.com/ProductImages/FTM-400DRXDR_thumb.jpg){.fig-center}

I bought the FTM-400 new in the box from K3ARL in the summer of 2022. 
He had bought it as a gift for his business partner and friend, Eric Brooks N3EB.
Sadly, N3EB died in the fall of 2021, and never got to enjoy the radio.
N3EB was one of my Elmers, and so I am glad that I get to enjoy this rig and remember Eric.

### Kenwood TM-281A

The Kenwood TM-281A is a mobile radio, but I use it in my home shack to support my [W3TM-11 I-Gate](https://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=11&call=a%2FW3TM-11&timerange=3600&tail=3600).

## APRS gear

### TNC-X kit

I have an unbuild TNC-X kit.
This is a board that connects with a Raspberry Pi.

### Byonics MicroTrak AIO

![](https://www.byonics.com/images/mt-aio-2a.300.jpg)
This is a 10 W APRS beacon.

I have used this to beacon APRS packets at the NARC Field Day.

Once, when this was my _only_ mobile APRS solution, I used this to plan a meeting with a person who had a short window of time to hand-off a piece of equipment.
The beacon helped them time when to come down to meet me.

### Mobilinkd TNC2

![](http://www.mobilinkd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_20170405_205938.gif)
This TNC2 can connect via Bluetooth with a computer, (iOS or Android) tablet, or (iOS or Android) phone and enables a simple HT to provide nearly full APRS capabilities.
