I acquired this radio used in the summer of 2021. It has the internal antenna tuning unit (ATU).

It connects to an [SPE Expert Linear 1K amplifier](amplifiers.qmd#spe-expert-linear-1k) on the Input 1 port.

### FlexRadio 1500

![FlexRadio 1500](https://www.universal-radio.com/used/US88.jpg)

This is a QRP SDR I acquired used in the summer of 2023.
I love the [PowerSDR application](https://ke9ns.com/flexpage.html) KE9NS has lovingly developed and maintained because the entire rig can be run from simple keyboard commands.
Haven't quite figured out what to do with it on a regular basis, but I do love this rig.

### ICOM IC-7300

This radio was new when I bought it in the summer of 2016.

It also connects to the [SPE Expert Linear 1K amplifier](amplifiers.qmd#spe-expert-linear-1k) on the Input 2 port.

### ICOM IC-705

## VHF/UHF

### ICOM IC-9700

![](https://www.gigaparts.com/media/catalog/product/cache/dfaec006bd6782dbad92b9435baa8bcf/i/c/ic_9700.jpg)
The IC-9700 is the newest rig in the shack.
I'm planning some additional VHF and UHF work with it, including satellites, and possibly a future APRStt project.
But for now, it's in the shack being used for local repeater operations.

I have experimented with remote control of this rig, but the latency is high.

More details about specific uses of the IC-9700 can be found [here](ic-9700.qmd).

### ICOM IC-705

The IC-705 is also capable of VHF and UHF operations at up to 10 W.

### Kenwood TM-710GA {}

![Kenwood TM-710G](https://kasc.kenwood.com/files/website/categories/11/comm/amateur-vhf_uhf_mobiles2.png){.fig-center}

This VHF (2 m)/UHF (70 cm) transceiver was purchased new in the summer of 2016.
It is installed in our Kia Forte.
I usually beacon APRS packets when I am mobile under the callsign W3TM-1.

### Yaesu FTM-400XDR

![Yaesu FTM-400XDR](https://www.yaesu.com/ProductImages/FTM-400DRXDR_thumb.jpg){.fig-center}

I bought the FTM-400 new in the box from K3ARL in the summer of 2022. 
He had bought it as a gift for his business partner and friend, Eric Brooks N3EB.
Sadly, N3EB died in the fall of 2021, and never got to enjoy the radio.
N3EB was one of my Elmers, and so I am glad that I get to enjoy this rig and remember Eric.

### Kenwood TM-281A

![Kenwood TM-281A](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/u1YAAOSwMvFivUWN/s-l500.jpg){.fig-center}

The Kenwood TM-281A is a mobile radio, but I use it in my home shack to support my [W3TM-11 I-Gate](https://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=11&call=a%2FW3TM-11&timerange=3600&tail=3600).

### Tytera TYT TH-8600

![Tytera TYT TH-8600](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61d1V-d4B4L._AC_SX679_.jpg)

This radio is the core of a go-box I use in mobile/portable operations.

### Kenwood TH-72A

![Kenwood TH-72A](https://www.kenwood.com/usa/com/amateur/th-d72a/images/image_product01_big.jpg)

I bought the [Kenwood TH-72A](https://www.kenwood.com/usa/com/amateur/th-d72a/) used several years ago.
This rigs are notable for supporting full duplex, a desirable characteristic for FM satellite work.


## Hotspots

### ClearNode

![ClearNode Allstar hotspot/node](https://www.node-ventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CN_1_med.jpg)

I run a UHF [ClearNode](https://node-ventures.com) Allstar hotspot.
My Allstar node number is 51401.

## APRS gear

### TNC-X kit

I have an unbuilt TNC-X kit.
This is a board that connects with a Raspberry Pi.

### Byonics MicroTrak AIO

![](https://www.byonics.com/images/mt-aio-2a.300.jpg)
This is a 10 W APRS beacon.

I have used this to beacon APRS packets at the NARC Field Day.

Once, when this was my _only_ mobile APRS solution, I used this to plan a meeting with a person who had a short window of time to hand-off a piece of equipment.
The beacon helped them time when to come down to meet me.

<!-- ### Mobilinkd TNC2 -->

<!-- ![](http://www.mobilinkd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_20170405_205938.gif) -->
<!-- This TNC2 can connect via Bluetooth with a computer, (iOS or Android) tablet, or (iOS or Android) phone and enables a simple HT to provide nearly full APRS capabilities. -->
