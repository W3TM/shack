Computers are an integral part of amateur radio.
Here are some descriptions of the computers I use in my operations.

## Windows

I have an Acer laptop in my home shack that is the main control computer for the Flex-6400 and logging computer for the Flex-6400 and the IC-7300.

I have an Evolve III netbook that I use for portable operations and to retrieve Winlink messages when I am at home using the IC-705 and the W3SWL-10 VHF Winlink node.

## Mac

## iOS

## Android

## Raspberry Pi
