This page describes various stations that I use.

## Home

### Shack

#### APRS I-Gate

#### HF 1

My primary HF station uses the FlexRadio 6400 transceiver.
The Flex drives an SPE Expert Linear 1K amplifier.
The radio has an X microphone.
An Acer laptop running SmartSDR 3.x.x is used to control the radio.

#### HF 2

### Office


### Office HF/VHF/UHF

### Allstar node

## Mobile

### Kia Forte

### Honda CRV

## Portable

### VHF/UHF Go-box

I have a Tytera TYT-8600 radio in a small go-box configuration with an included 12 Ah Bioenno $LiFePO_4$ battery.

## Remote

One technical challenge I enjoy involves remote operations.

### Flex-6400

The Flex-6400 can be remotely operated via the SmartConnect link embedded in the radio's software.

I especially enjoy using the [Mac OS](https://roskosch.de/smartsdr-for-mac/) and [iOS](https://roskosch.de/smartsdr-features/) SmartSDR clients.
They work extremely well.

### ICOM IC-705

The same developer of the SmartSDR for Mac and iOS has developed a set of applications for remote access to selected ICOM transceivers called SDR-Control.
The application runs on [MacOS](https://roskosch.de/sdr-control/), [iPad](https://roskosch.de/sdr-control-ios/), and [iPhone](https://roskosch.de/sdr-control-mobile/).

I have successfully used SDR-Control to access my IC-705, and have tested it with another operator's IC-7610.

### ICOM IC-7300

The IC-7300 does not have the network circuitry needed to permit "out-of-the-box" control like the IC-705 or IC-7610 using SDR-Control. Apparently, there is a USB control option that I have yet to explore.

However, I do use and enjoy remote control of my IC-7300 using the [RemoteTx.net service](https://remotetx.net).
This service allows me to access my IC-7300 from a web browser.
