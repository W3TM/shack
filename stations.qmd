### Shack

<<<<<<< HEAD
I have a small room in our basement set aside for my radio shack.

#### APRS I-Gate

The W3TM-11 APRS I-Gate uses the [Kenwood TM-281A](rigs.qmd#kenwood-tm-281a) connected to a Mac Mini running Ubuntu and the direwolf software TNC. I have a 2 m/70 cm J-pole antenna on the roof of my house at about 6 m from the ground.

#### APRS-tt station

Since fall of 2023, I have been experimenting with an APRS-tt (touch-tone) station using the [IC-9700](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-9700) connected to an Acer Laptop running Direwolf 1.7.

The station is configured to log-in to the APRS-IS network under W3TM-8. When the right sequence of DTMF tones is entered, I (and a couple of ham friends) are able to have our positions reported nearby some locations that are relevant to area hams: our mountaintop club station, the 146.85 W3YA and 146.76 W3GA repeaters, Hoss's Restaurant, and the location where we hold our monthly club meetings.

More specific details about the rig and PC settings for this station can be found [here](ic-9700.qmd#aprs-tt).

#### HF 1

My primary HF station that I am callign HF 1 just for fun uses the [FlexRadio 6400](rigs.qmd#flexradio-6400) transceiver.
The Flex drives an [SPE Expert Linear 1K amplifier](amplifiers.qmd#spe-expert-linear-1k).
The radio has an [Inrad M629](https://www.flexradio.com/wp-content/uploads/M629__29896.1676037008.1280.1280.jpg) microphone.
An Acer laptop running [SmartSDR 3.5.9](https://www.flexradio.com/ssdr/ssdr-for-windows/) is used to control the radio.

#### HF 2

My second HF station runs an [IC-7300](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-7300).
It also connects to the [SPE Expert Linear 1K amplifier](amplifiers.qmd#spe-expert-linear-1k).
I use either the stock hand mic or a [Heil Proset iC](https://heilhamradio.com/product/pro-set/#dipipopup-9149) headset with a footswitch.

#### Allstar node

I have a [ClearNode](https://www.node-ventures.com/buy-clearnode/) UHF Allstar node on 51401.
The node also supports EchoLink (W3TM-L).

I used this node for the [K3P](engagement.qmd#pride-k3p) Special Event station in June 2023. At least two hams connected via the node to participate in the event.

### Office

#### HF 3 (QRP/VHF/UHF)

A third HF station is located in my office.
I'm running the [IC-705](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-705).
At the moment, the HF capability is receive-only, as I have a [W6LVP](https://www.w6lvp.com/product/w6lvp-amplified-receive-only-magnetic-loop-antenna/) receive only magnetic loop for the HF antenna.
The VHF/UHF side of the rig is connected to a slim jim antenna.
Both antennas connect via a diplexer.

#### Allstar node

I have a [ClearNode](https://www.node-ventures.com/buy-clearnode/) UHF Allstar node on 51401.
The node also supports EchoLink (W3TM-L).

I used this node for the K3P Special Event station in June 2023. At least two hams connected via the node to participate in the event.

## Mobile

### Kia Forte

A [Kenwood TM-710GA](rigs.qmd#kenwood-tm-710ga) is used in this vehicle for FM (VHF & UHF) voice communications.
The rig also beacons APRS packets as W3TM-1.
I usually have it configured with APRS voice alert.

### Honda CRV

A [Yaesu FTM-400XDR](rigs.qmd#yaesu-FTM-400xdr) is used in this vehicle for FM (VHF & UHF) voice communications.
The rig also beacons APRS packets as W3TM-2.
I usually have it configured with APRS voice alert.

## Portable

### VHF/UHF Go-box

I have a [Tytera TYT-8600](rigs.qmd#tytera-tyt-th-8600) radio in a small go-box configuration with an included 12 Ah Bioenno $LiFePO_4$ battery.

### Satellite station

The [IC-9700](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-9700) forms the heart of my still-in-progress satellite station.
Also new is the [CSN Technologies Self-contained Antenna Tracker (S.A.T.)](http://www.csntechnologies.net/sat).
This interfaces with the IC-9700 and an antenna rotator.
It provides a web browser interface for most controls.
Within a few minutes of connecting it, I was able to monitor DX traffic (Alabama!) on the ISS FM repeater using my vertically oriented Comet antenna.

Finally, I am assembling an [$M^2$ SATPACK1](https://www.m2inc.com/FGSATPACK1) antenna array.
If my initial forays go well, I may think about upgrading to a system with Yagis that can be pointed at satellites.

### Packet

I've recently assembled a portable VHF packet/APRS/Winlink station.
The radio is the [ICOM ID-51a](rigs.qmd#icom-id-51a).
A [Digirig](https://digirig.net) device with a cable specifically designed for ICOM HTs provides sound card and PTT functions.

::: {.callout-note}

The ID-51a supports CAT control via CI-V, and Digirig could support this.
But CAT control is overkill for this use case.
It's trivial to change the radio frequency manually, and the mode does not need to change.

The Digirig cable takes the grounded speaker line from the ID-51a and sends it as an RTS signal to the computer.
So, once I've set the packet software to use the correct COM port on the PC, PTT works well.
The virtue of this scheme is that it can also work with other HTs. 

:::

An Evolve III netbook running Windows 10 runs the relevant software.
I'm using the [UH7HO Soundmodem](http://uz7.ho.ua/packetradio.htm) package for packet radio TNC services, [Dire Wolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf) as an APRS TNC, and [Outpost Packet Message Manager](https://www.outpostpm.org/index.php) as a packet terminal client. I also use [Winlink](https://www.winlink.org), and the [VARA FM](https://rosmodem.wordpress.com) Winlink client, but of course, I could also use standard packet as the Winlink client.

The [IC-705](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-705) can also work as a portable FM + HF packet station 
using the same PC.
I'm experimenting with making different copies of Soundmodem and VARA FM and then naming them for the different rig configurations, as neither package supports switching between multiple rigs.

## Remote

One technical challenge I enjoy involves remote operations.

### Flex-6400

The [Flex-6400](rigs.qmd#flexradio-6400) can be remotely operated via the SmartConnect link embedded in the radio's software.

I especially enjoy using the [Mac OS](https://roskosch.de/smartsdr-for-mac/) and [iOS](https://roskosch.de/smartsdr-features/) SmartSDR clients.
They work extremely well.

### ICOM IC-705

The same developer of the SmartSDR for Mac and iOS has developed a set of applications for remote access to selected ICOM transceivers called SDR-Control.
The application runs on [MacOS](https://roskosch.de/sdr-control/), [iPad](https://roskosch.de/sdr-control-ios/), and [iPhone](https://roskosch.de/sdr-control-mobile/).

I have successfully used SDR-Control to access my [IC-705](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-705), and have tested it with another operator's IC-7610.

### ICOM IC-7300

The [IC-7300](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-7300) does not have the network circuitry needed to permit "out-of-the-box" control like the [IC-705](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-705) or IC-7610 using SDR-Control. Apparently, there is a USB control option that I have yet to explore.

However, I do use and enjoy remote control of my [IC-7300](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-7300) using the [RemoteTx.net service](https://remotetx.net).
This service allows me to access my IC-7300 from a web browser.

I have experimented with remote control via an early version of the RigPi station server.

### ICOM IC-9700

The [9700](rigs.qmd#icom-ic-9700) can be controlled remotely via the SDR-Control and SDR-Mobile apps.

### NARC mountaintop stations

Some colleagues and I have been experimenting with remote access to the NARC mountaintop station's IC-7610 and Flex 6400M radios.
Access to the IC-7610 is easy via the MacOS SDR-Control or iOS SDR-Mobile apps, but this requires connecting to the NARC VPN.
Access to the Flex 6400M can be made via SmartLink and SmartSDR for Windows, Mac OS, or iOS.
We have a very nice array of antennas "up at the mountain," so this has been an enjoyable experiment.
